## üó∫Ô∏è Workflow Graph

### Agent Workflow Explanation
The Mogambo agent uses a modular, state-driven workflow powered by LangGraph. Here‚Äôs how the workflow operates:

1. **Mode Detection:**  
   The agent first determines if the input is text or voice. If voice, it transcribes the input using SpeechRecognition.

2. **Intent Analysis:**  
   The agent analyzes the user‚Äôs request using MistralAI, classifying the intent (e.g., create, update, retrieve, delete event, find free/busy, or general conversation).  
   It merges new information with previous context and asks for clarification if required fields are missing.

3. **Tool Routing:**  
   Based on the detected intent, the workflow routes to the appropriate node:  
   - **Create Event:** Validates and creates a calendar event.  
   - **Retrieve Events:** Fetches events in a specified time range.  
   - **Update Event:** Updates an event, resolving ambiguous references using context and event IDs.  
   - **Delete Event:** Deletes an event, confirming selection if multiple matches are found.  
   - **Find Free/Busy:** Checks calendar availability for a given time range.  
   If the intent is general conversation or clarification, it routes directly to response generation.

4. **Response Generation:**  
   The agent generates a natural language response, referencing context, event IDs, and prior history for traceability.

5. **Text-to-Speech (Voice Mode):**  
   If the session is in voice mode, the response is converted to speech using gTTS and played back to the user.

6. **Conversation History & Context:**  
   All exchanges, event selections, and operations are logged for auditability and compliance.

This workflow ensures robust, context-aware scheduling, expert-level clarification, and seamless voice/text interaction. The modular design allows easy extension for new features and domain-specific automation.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Mogambo-Voice-AI-Scheduler
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - For Windows: `pip install pyaudio`
   - For Linux: `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`
   - For macOS: `brew install portaudio && pip install pyaudio`
3. **Configure Google OAuth:**
   - Create a Google Cloud project and OAuth credentials.
   - Download `credentials.json` and place it in the project root.
   - Set environment variables in `.env`:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
     SESSION_SECRET_KEY=your-session-secret
     MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-mistral-apikey
     REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/auth/callback
     ```
4. **Run the server:**
   ```sh
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
5. **Access the app:**
   - Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## üó£Ô∏è Usage Guide
- **Login:** Authenticate via Google OAuth for secure calendar access.
- **Chat:** Type or speak your requests‚Äî"Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 3pm", "Show my events for next week", etc.
- **Voice Mode:** Toggle voice mode in the chat UI, record your message, and let Mogambo handle transcription and intent.
- **Event Selection:** For ambiguous update/delete requests, Mogambo will present possible matches with event IDs and summaries for you to select.
