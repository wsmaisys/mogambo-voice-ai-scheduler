## üöÄ Project Vision
Mogambo Voice AI Scheduler is a privacy-first, expert-grade calendar assistant. It combines advanced AI, robust voice recognition, and seamless Google Calendar automation to deliver context-aware scheduling and natural conversation‚Äîvia both text and voice. Mogambo is engineered for reliability, security, and intelligent automation, making it ideal for top professionals and teams.

- **Voice & Text Input:** Natural interaction with backend voice transcription and secure processing.
- **Google Calendar Automation:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete events with full traceability and security.
- **Intelligent Event Matching:** Automatically suggests event matches (with event IDs and summaries) for ambiguous requests, ensuring precise updates and deletions.
- **Clarification Workflow:** Prompts for missing information, referencing prior context for expert-level conversation.
- **Privacy & Security:** Zero data retention, instant logout on window close, and session isolation.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, beautiful chat and calendar interface powered by Bootstrap and FullCalendar.

## üó∫Ô∏è Workflow Graph
![Workflow Graph](workflow_graph.png)

The above image illustrates the overall workflow of the Mogambo Voice AI Scheduler application. It provides a visual representation of how the system processes user inputs, detects intents, routes tasks, and generates responses. This diagram serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the modular and state-driven architecture of the app.

### Agent Workflow Explanation
The Mogambo agent uses a modular, state-driven workflow powered by LangGraph. Here‚Äôs how the workflow operates:

1. **Mode Detection:**  
   The agent first determines if the input is text or voice. If voice, it transcribes the input using SpeechRecognition.

2. **Intent Analysis:**  
   The agent analyzes the user‚Äôs request using MistralAI, classifying the intent (e.g., create, update, retrieve, delete event, find free/busy, or general conversation).  
   It merges new information with previous context and asks for clarification if required fields are missing.

3. **Tool Routing:**  
   Based on the detected intent, the workflow routes to the appropriate node:  
   - **Create Event:** Validates and creates a calendar event.  
   - **Retrieve Events:** Fetches events in a specified time range.  
   - **Update Event:** Updates an event, resolving ambiguous references using context and event IDs.  
   - **Delete Event:** Deletes an event, confirming selection if multiple matches are found.  
   - **Find Free/Busy:** Checks calendar availability for a given time range.  
   If the intent is general conversation or clarification, it routes directly to response generation.

4. **Response Generation:**  
   The agent generates a natural language response, referencing context, event IDs, and prior history for traceability.

5. **Text-to-Speech (Voice Mode):**  
   If the session is in voice mode, the response is converted to speech using gTTS and played back to the user.

6. **Conversation History & Context:**  
   All exchanges, event selections, and operations are logged for auditability and compliance.

This workflow ensures robust, context-aware scheduling, expert-level clarification, and seamless voice/text interaction. The modular design allows easy extension for new features and domain-specific automation.

## üß† Unique Technical Differentiators
- **Autonomous AI Agent:** LangGraph, LangChain, and MistralAI for advanced intent analysis and workflow orchestration.
- **Voice Recognition:** SpeechRecognition, pydub, and gTTS for robust, cross-platform audio handling.
- **Event Traceability:** Every event selection, update, and deletion is logged in the conversation history for auditability.
- **Session Security:** Enforced via FastAPI middleware and frontend scripts‚Äîno user data is stored after logout.
- **Expert-Grade Error Handling:** All errors are surfaced with actionable feedback, and the system self-corrects where possible.
